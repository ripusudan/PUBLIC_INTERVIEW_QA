# JAVA8 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1. **What are the main features introduced in Java 8?**
   - Lambda expressions
   - Functional interfaces
   - Stream API
   - Default methods in interfaces
   - New Date and Time API (java.time package)

2. **What is a lambda expression in Java 8?**
   - Lambda expressions introduce a concise way to represent anonymous functions. They are used primarily to define inline implementation of a functional interface.

3. **What is a functional interface?**
   - A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. It can have multiple default or static methods, but only one abstract method.

4. **How are lambda expressions used with functional interfaces?**
   - Lambda expressions provide a compact way to implement the single abstract method of a functional interface.

5. **What is the Stream API in Java 8?**
   - The Stream API is used to process sequences of elements (collections) in a functional style. It allows you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing on those collections.

6. **What is the difference between `map` and `flatMap` in the Stream API?**
   - `map` transforms each element of the stream using the provided function.
   - `flatMap` transforms each element into a stream of other objects and then flattens those streams into a single stream.

7. **Explain the `forEach` method in the Stream API.**
   - `forEach` is a terminal operation in the Stream API that performs an action for each element of the stream. It is used for side-effects and does not return a value.

8. **What is a method reference in Java 8?**
   - Method reference is a shorthand syntax of a lambda expression to call a method. It simplifies lambda expressions when the method body just calls another method.

9. **What are default methods in interfaces?**
   - Default methods allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementation classes. Classes implementing the interface can use or override the default method.

10. **How is the `Optional` class used in Java 8?**
    - `Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It is used to handle NullPointerExceptions more gracefully.

11. **What is the new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8?**
    - The new Date and Time API is part of the java.time package and provides classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, etc., to handle date and time without the need for formatting.

12. **Explain the `peek` method in the Stream API.**
    - `peek` is an intermediate operation in the Stream API that allows performing an action on each element of the stream without changing the elements. It is mainly used for debugging.

13. **What is the `Collector` interface in Java 8?**
    - The `Collector` interface provides a set of reduction operations like `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, `toList`, `toSet`, etc., that can be used with the `collect` method of the Stream API.

14. **How does the `reduce` operation work in the Stream API?**
    - The `reduce` operation performs a reduction on the elements of the stream using an associative accumulation function and returns an `Optional` representing the reduced value.

15. **Explain the concept of parallel streams in Java 8.**
    - Parallel streams allow the Stream API to perform parallel processing of elements. It can significantly improve performance on multicore processors.

16. **What is the `Supplier` interface in Java 8?**
    - The `Supplier` interface represents a supplier of results and has a single method `get()`.

17. **What are the benefits of using the `CompletableFuture` class in Java 8?**
    - `CompletableFuture` is used for asynchronous programming. It provides a more flexible way to express asynchronous computations and compose multiple asynchronous operations.

18. **How is the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation used in Java 8?**
    - `@FunctionalInterface` is used to indicate that an interface is intended to be a functional interface, which means it has exactly one abstract method.

19. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.function` package in Java 8?**
    - The `java.util.function` package contains functional interfaces that can be used as lambda expressions or method references. It includes interfaces like `Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, etc.

20. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.stream.Collectors` class?**
    - The `Collectors` class in the `java.util.stream` package provides various useful reduction operations like grouping, summing, counting, joining, etc., that can be used with the `collect` method of the Stream API.

21. **How does the `groupingBy` collector work in Java 8?**
    - The `groupingBy` collector is used to group elements of a stream by a classifier function. It returns a `Map` where keys are the result of applying the classifier function, and values are Lists of items.

22. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.function.Predicate` interface?**
    - The `Predicate` interface represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument. It is often used to filter elements in a stream.

23. **Explain the `BiFunction` interface in Java 8.**
    - The `BiFunction` interface represents a function that takes two arguments and produces a result. It has the method `apply(T t, U u)`.

24. **How does the `thenCompose` method of the `CompletableFuture` class work?**
    - The `thenCompose` method is used for chaining two `CompletableFuture` instances. It takes a function that produces another `CompletableFuture` and returns a new `CompletableFuture` that is the result of the composed computation.

25. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.function.Consumer` interface?**
    - The `Consumer` interface represents an operation that takes a single input argument and returns no result. It is often used to perform side effects.

26. **How does the `Collectors.joining` collector work in Java 8?**
    - The `Collectors.joining` collector concatenates the elements of a stream into a single `String`. It can take optional parameters for delimiter, prefix, and suffix.

27. **Explain the `zoneId` in the `java.time.ZonedDateTime` class.**
    - `zoneId` represents the time zone in the `ZonedDateTime` class. It is an identifier used to identify the rules used to convert between an `Instant` and a `LocalDateTime`.

28. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.function.Supplier` interface?**
    - The `Supplier` interface represents a supplier of results and has a single method `get()`. It is often used to lazily generate values.

29. **How does the `partitioningBy` collector work in Java 8?**
    - The `partitioningBy` collector is used to partition elements of a stream into two groups based on a predicate. It returns a `Map<Boolean, List<T>>` where `true` keys represent elements satisfying the predicate, and `false` keys represent elements not satisfying the predicate.

30. **What is the purpose of the `java.util.function.Function` interface?**
    - The `Function` interface represents a function that takes one argument and produces a result. It is often used to transform elements in a stream.

These questions cover a range of topics related to Java 8 features and concepts. Depending on the depth of knowledge expected, you may need to elaborate on your answers during an interview.
