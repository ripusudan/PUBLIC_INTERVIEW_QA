   - Strong encapsulation
   - Improved security
   - Better maintainability
   - Scalability of large applications

4. **How do you declare a module in Java 9?**
   - You use the `module-info.java` file to declare a module. It includes the module name, dependencies, and exported packages.

5. **Explain the `jlink` tool in Java 9.**
   - The `jlink` tool is used to assemble and optimize a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom runtime image.

6. **What is the purpose of the `jshell` tool introduced in Java 9?**
   - `jshell` is an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool that allows developers to experiment, evaluate, and test Java code snippets.

7. **How does the `HttpClient` API in Java 9 differ from the old `HttpURLConnection` class?**
   - The `HttpClient` API provides a more flexible and efficient way to send HTTP requests and handle responses, supporting HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.

8. **Explain the concept of reactive streams in Java 9.**
   - Reactive Streams provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure. They are designed to handle asynchronous streams of data with efficient memory usage.

9. **What are the improvements made to the Process API in Java 9?**
   - Java 9 introduced the `ProcessHandle` class, which provides methods to inspect and manage native processes.

10. **How do you create an immutable list in Java 9 using the `List.of` method?**
    - In Java 9, you can create an immutable list using the `List.of` factory method. For example: `List<String> immutableList = List.of("item1", "item2");`

11. **Explain the new methods introduced in the `Stream` interface in Java 9.**
    - Java 9 introduced several methods in the `Stream` interface, including `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, `iterate`, and `ofNullable`. These methods enhance the functionality of streams.

12. **How does Java 9 handle multi-release JARs?**
    - Java 9 introduced the concept of multi-release JARs, allowing developers to include different versions of class files for different Java versions within the same JAR file.

13. **What is the `try-with-resources` statement, and how does it change in Java 9?**
    - The `try-with-resources` statement automatically closes resources. In Java 9, it supports effectively final variables, allowing resources to be declared outside the try-with-resources statement.

14. **Explain the enhancements made to the `Optional` class in Java 9.**
    - Java 9 introduced additional methods to the `Optional` class, such as `ifPresentOrElse`, `or`, and `stream`, providing more flexibility when working with optional values.

15. **How does Java 9 improve the `CompletableFuture` class?**
    - Java 9 introduced additional methods to the `CompletableFuture` class, including `orTimeout`, `completeOnTimeout`, and `newIncompleteFuture`, enhancing its capabilities for asynchronous programming.

16. **What is the purpose of the `Stack-Walking API` in Java 9?**
    - The `Stack-Walking API` provides a way to walk the stack trace and access information about the calling methods. It is more efficient than the traditional approach using `Thread.getStackTrace()`.

17. **Explain the enhancements to the `ProcessBuilder` class in Java 9.**
    - Java 9 introduced additional methods to the `ProcessBuilder` class, including `inheritIO` and `redirectError`, making it more convenient to configure and start processes.

18. **How does Java 9 handle version-string schemes for modules?**
    - Java 9 introduced a version-string scheme for modules, allowing developers to specify version information for modules using the `module-info.java` file.

19. **What is the purpose of the `Compact Strings` feature in Java 9?**
    - The `Compact Strings` feature aims to reduce the memory footprint of strings by storing characters as byte arrays when possible, resulting in more efficient memory usage.

20. **How does Java 9 enhance the `@SafeVarargs` annotation?**
    - In Java 9, the `@SafeVarargs` annotation can be applied not only to methods with a final or effectively final parameter but also to private methods.

21. **What is the purpose of the `VarHandle` class introduced in Java 9?**
    - The `VarHandle` class provides a way to perform atomic and ordered operations on fields of objects, allowing for low-level, efficient access to variables.

22. **Explain the changes made to the `Comparator` interface in Java 9.**
    - Java 9 introduced several static methods in the `Comparator` interface, including `naturalOrder` and `nullsFirst`, simplifying common comparator patterns.

23. **How does Java 9 improve the `java.util.concurrent.Flow` API?**
    - Java 9 introduced the `java.util.concurrent.Flow` API for reactive programming, providing interfaces like `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, and `Subscription` to support reactive streams.

24. **What is the `processAPI` in Java 9, and how does it differ from the traditional `Runtime.exec` method?**
    - Java 9 introduced the `ProcessHandle` class in the `processAPI`, providing more functionality and control over native processes compared to the traditional `Runtime.exec` method.

25. **Explain the `Compact Number Formatting` feature in Java 9.**
    - The `Compact Number Formatting` feature in Java 9 allows for formatting numbers in a more compact form suitable for display in limited space, such as on mobile devices.

26. **What is the `Diamond Operator` in Java, and how does it work in Java 9?**
    - The `Diamond Operator` (`<>`) allows the compiler to infer the type parameters of a generic class instantiation. Java 9 did not introduce significant changes to the `Diamond Operator`.

27. **How does Java 9 enhance the `java.util.concurrent` package?**
    - Java9 introduced enhancements to the `java.util.concurrent` package, including new methods in the `CompletableFuture` class and the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.

28. **What is the `Multi-Resolution Image API` introduced in Java 9?**
    - The `Multi-Resolution Image API` provides a way to represent and work with multi-resolution images, allowing developers to provide different versions of an image for different display resolutions.

29. **Explain the `Resource Encapsulation` feature in Java 9.**
    - `Resource Encapsulation` in Java 9 improves encapsulation by encapsulating internal APIs and making them inaccessible to code outside the Java SE Platform.

30. **How does Java 9 improve the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package?**
    - Java 9 introduced new methods in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, such as `updateAndGet` and `accumulateAndGet`, providing more flexible atomic operations.

Please note that Java evolves over time, and newer versions may introduce additional features or changes. Be sure to keep up with the latest Java releases for any updates beyond Java 9.
