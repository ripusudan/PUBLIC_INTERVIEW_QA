Question: What is the difference between document and window object in js
Answer:
In JavaScript, the "document" and "window" objects are both part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and are crucial for interacting with and manipulating web pages,
but they serve different purposes and represent different aspects of the web page.

1. document object:
   - The document object represents the entire HTML document loaded in a web page.
   - It provides access to the structure and content of the web page, including elements, text, and attributes.
   - You can use the document object to select, manipulate, and query elements within the document using methods like getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, 
     and more.
   - It does not have direct access to the browser window itself; it primarily deals with the content of the web page.

Example:
// Select an element with the ID "myElement" using the document object
var element = document.getElementById("myElement");


2. window object:
   - The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded.
   - It provides access to various browser-related functionalities, such as controlling the window's size, navigation, and events.
   - You can use the window object to manipulate the browser's behavior, set timeouts, handle events, and open or close new windows or tabs.
   - It is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript environment.

Example:
// Open a new browser window
var newWindow = window.open("https://www.example.com");

// Set a timeout to execute a function after a delay
window.setTimeout(function() {
    // This code will execute after the specified delay
}, 2000);

In summary, the document object is primarily concerned with the content and structure of the web page, 
allowing you to interact with and manipulate its elements, while the window object focuses on browser-related actions and control, 
such as managing windows, handling events, and timers. Both objects are essential for web development, 
and understanding their differences and capabilities is crucial for building interactive and dynamic web applications.
