## What is powermock in junit.
PowerMock is a framework that extends other mock libraries like EasyMock and Mockito to enable mocking of static methods, constructors, and other normally unmockable aspects of Java classes. It is commonly used in conjunction with JUnit for unit testing.

Here's a simple example of using JUnit with PowerMock and Mockito to mock static methods:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.powermock.api.mockito.PowerMockito;
import org.powermock.core.classloader.annotations.PrepareForTest;
import org.powermock.modules.junit4.PowerMockRunner;

// This annotation is used to prepare the class for testing with PowerMockito
@PrepareForTest(StaticClass.class)
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
public class MyTest {

    @Test
    public void testStaticMethod() {
        // Mocking static methods
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(StaticClass.class);
        when(StaticClass.staticMethod()).thenReturn("Mocked result");

        // Your test logic that calls the static method
        String result = StaticClass.staticMethod();

        // Verify that the mocked method was called and the result is as expected
        verifyStatic(StaticClass.class);
        assertEquals("Mocked result", result);

        // Clean up the static mock
        PowerMockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions(StaticClass.class);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)` is used to run the test with PowerMock.
- `@PrepareForTest(StaticClass.class)` is used to prepare the specified class for testing with PowerMockito. You should replace `StaticClass` with the actual class that contains the static method you want to mock.

Remember that using PowerMock is generally not recommended unless necessary, as it may indicate design issues in your code. Mocking static methods or constructors often suggests that your code might benefit from some refactoring to improve testability.

Make sure to include the PowerMock dependencies in your project build file. If you're using Maven, you can add the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.powermock</groupId>
        <artifactId>powermock-module-junit4</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.9</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.powermock</groupId>
        <artifactId>powermock-api-mockito2</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.9</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
